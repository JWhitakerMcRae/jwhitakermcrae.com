					<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I am a native born Floridian who attended the University of Florida to dual major in Mechanical and Aerospace engineering. An avid outdoorsman, I am an Eagle Scout who still loves mountain biking, snow skiing, and in general being in the great outdoors. Technology is a special love of mine, and I believe the very existence of it is to free humans to enjoy a better quality of life and pursue more worthy endeavors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon getting my degrees at UF, I began working full time for a flight simulation leader for whom I had interned in college, CAE USA in Tampa. For over 3 years I worked as a Department of Defense contractor specializing in Military Simulation and Training, a field that I would later make a brief return to becoming the Avionics Group Lead for TRU Simulation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Leaving CAE USA, I joined Performance Software, a much smaller company specializing in DO-178B flight critical embedded software and looking to enter the ever emerging healthcare sector. Here I had the privilege of leading a small firmware team to develop the Collimator subsystem of GE's Revolution CT machine, co-developing the Patient Management UI application for Sonosite Fujifilm’s new iViz tablet ultrasound device and performing updates and testing on multiple flight related devices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Drawn back into the fast paced environment of simulation, I accepted a position at TRU Simulation and was quickly promoted to Avionics Group Lead of the company. Here I was also the Software Lead for the Bell 505 Jet Ranger X Flight Training Device, now at the Bell Training Facility in Fort Worth, TX, however shortly after this I accepted an exciting position with an IoT smart building startup called Gooee.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Gooee I ran the bluetooth mesh IoT Test Lab, a purpose built 14,000 sq. ft testing facility, designed to test all aspects of the wireless mesh network + develop a suite of test programs to validate cloud and gateway functions, along with building data analytics simulations. Many iterations of bluetooth mesh and sensor firmware were tweaked and validated by our team there, however after a few years I decided to follow my passion of mountain biking which led me to the mountains of Greenville, South Carolina.
					</p>
					<p>
						After whetting my appetite for general computing with real-time simulation and then real-time embedded devices, scaling into solutions made of complex systems, I have become a bit of a hobbyist in other realms of development. I joined an EV startup called Proterra, working on the telemetry system for their bus fleet, then became the Director of Engineering for an LED company serving the first responder market.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the side I have founded 2 small startups, developed an Android Wear application published to the Google Play Store, and written an ever growing handful of utilities and tools for my own personal use. These tools are written in languages ranging from low-level C to higher level Python and Java, and I hope in time to be able to share many of these utilities with you on my website!
